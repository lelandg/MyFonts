# MyFonts
A simple Python app to quickly show all your fonts, along with examples of all letters, numbers and (common) punctuation.

Requires Python (Anaconda, or something to run Python with). To install the requirements, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the app, run:

Enhancements are planned. Stay tuned!
